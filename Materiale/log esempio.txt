Double the power of normal bullets.\r\nENERGYTANK: Partial energy recovery.\r\nSIDEFIGHTER: Increases offensive power.\r\nYASHICHI: Maximum energy recovery.\r\n\r\n* Choose Your Weapon: Hold these buttons at the beginning of each stage to activate the weapon... \r\nStage 1 for a Small Shot Gun, press 1P side Down and 2P side A. \r\nStage 2 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side A and 2P side B. \r\nStage 3 for a Laser, press 1P side Upright+A+B and 2P side Down+B. \r\nStage 4 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side Downleft+B and 2P side Leftup. \r\nStage 5 for a 3-way, press 1P side A and 2P side Up. \r\nStage 6 for an Auto, press 1P side Left and 2P side Right+B. \r\nStage 7 for a Shell, press 1P side Upleft and 2P side Down. \r\nStage 8 for a 3-way, press 1P side Left+A+B and 2P side A+B. \r\nStage 9 for a Laser, press 1P side Downright+A+B and 2P side Downright+A+B. \r\nStage 10 for a Shell, press 1P side Upright+B and 2P side Downright. \r\nStage 11 for an Auto, press 1P side Upleft and 2P Right+A. \r\nStage 12 for a 3-way, press 1P side Right+A+B and 2P side Upright+A+B. \r\nStage 13 for an Auto, press 1P side Up and 2P side Down. \r\nStage 14 for a Laser, press 1P side Upleft+A+B and 2P side Right+A+B. \r\nStage 15 for a Shell, press 1P side Downright+A and 2P side Downleft+A. \r\nStage 16 for an Auto, press 1P side Right+A and 2P side Upright+A. \r\n\r\n* Full Ammunition Load: A little known trick in the game is to hold down the fire button at the very end of a board immediately after beating the boss. By holding down the button until the plane takes off in the subsequent board, the game gives you a full ammunition load (65 Seconds)! This trick only works every third board or so and it may even change your selected weapon. \r\n\r\n* The '100% accuracy' bonus refers NOT to how many planes you down during the round, but rather how many of the guns on the enemy aircraft carriers you get. For this reason, it's best to ignore the planes and concentrate on the ships - that's where the big points are. \r\n\r\n* It's possible to shoot one of the ships just before your plane dives in to battle the fleet, and that you can capture the flames that erupt from it. This gives a 10,000 point bonus. \r\n\r\n* At some points in the background there are 'shootable' patches which will yield a bonus when shot enough. They can be recognized by the sparks which will occur when your bullets hit them. One such bonus is on level one: it is on the lowest part of the second cloud bank to the left after the last large plane of the level appears. It appears as a cow. There is also another shootable area which appears after the first ship in the first level, in the water above it. \r\n1) The cow bonus is worth 20,000 points, and on the first level, it's followed by a strange object that looks like a dragonfly moving right to left across the screen. Shooting the dragonfly yields an additional 10,000 point bonus. \r\n2) The cow and dragonfly bonuses also appear on other rounds; the cow can sometimes be seen on the deck of a carrier! \r\n3) There's a bonus shaped like a spinning cat (!). When collected, it upgrades your weapon to a laser. \r\n\r\n* The 'star' bonus gives you 5,000 points when caught. It may also increase the capacity of your fuel gauge by eight units (mine went from 64 to 72 units). The white star also gives you the max seconds of weapon (if you get it with no weapon, the next time you get one you'll get 64 seconds instead of 20). \r\n\r\n* (This has been reported on level two, but may exist on other levels as well): Sometimes an astronaut will emerge from the side of the final (boss) ship and walk off the screen. Shoot it for 100,000 points! This happens most often when the command tower is shot repeatedly before the ship is destroyed. \r\n\r\n* If you get the 'propeller' power-up (it looks like a propeller over a circle), your energy level will be fully replenished. \r\n\r\n* Still another bonus is shaped like an pine cone or acorn. When you fly over a certain spot, the pine cone shows up and is worth 2,000 points. \r\n\r\n* When the boss ship explodes, the control center breaks into four pieces. The pieces are worth 10,000 points each if shot. \r\n\r\n* If you shoot a POW enough to cycle it through about four or five times, it will turn into a fuel-tank:) that helps a GREAT deal on the last few stages, especially a stage or two where they DON'T give you a full tank at the end of the cloud stage before you go to the water!\r\n\r\n- SERIES -\r\n\r\n1. 1942 (1984) \r\n2. 1943 - Midway Kaisen (1987) \r\n3. 1943 Kai - Midway Kaisen (1988) \r\n4. 1941 - Counter Attack [B-Board 89625B-1] (1990) \r\n5. 19XX - The War Against Destiny [Green Board] (1995) \r\n6. 1944 - The Loop Master [Green Board] (2000)\r\n7. 1942 - Joint Strike (2008, PSN\/XBLA)\r\n\r\n- STAFF -\r\n\r\nDesigners: Noritaka Funamizu (Poo), Dechikun \r\nProducer: Yoshiki Okamoto (Kikaji O.) \r\nCharacter designers: Naoko Sato, Miki Chan, Kawamoyan, Aho no Sakata \r\nMusic & SFX: Yoshihiro Sakaguchi \r\nAdditional music: Junko Tamiya (stage 1-1), Manami Matsumae (stage 1-2), Harumi Fujita (stages 2-2 and 3-1) \r\nHardware: Panchi Kubozoo (Punch Kubozoo), Jumbo Saito \r\nProgramming: BLBON\r\n\r\n- PORTS -\r\n\r\nHere is a list of Japanese ports.

The game is strategic in the fact that you must plan your moves as you climb up the building and anticipate the hazards that await you. You start out the game at the bottom of a building to be scaled. As you climb up the building, you will be assailed by bald people throwing flowerpots, signs with loose electrical wires, very large apes, falling signs, trash and barbells, and a bird that likes to drop bad things on your character. Your goal is to make it to the top of the building and catch the helicopter, which will transport you to the next building to be scaled. Of course, you will be rewarded for quickly making it up the building by getting a bonus (that is as long as you can catch the helicopter). The things one does for publicity.\r\n\r\n- TECHNICAL -\r\n\r\nUpright model # CCA-7001\r\n\r\nProm Stickers: CC\r\n\r\nMain CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)\r\nSound Chips: General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.536 Mhz), Discrete circuitry\r\n\r\nScreen orientation: Horizontal\r\nVideo resolution: 256 x 224 pixels\r\nScreen refresh: 60.00 Hz\r\nPalette colors: 96\r\n\r\nPlayers: 2\r\nControl: Double 8-way joysticks\r\n\r\n- TRIVIA -\r\n\r\nCrazy Climber was released in October 1980. It was Fujiwara's first game.\r\n\r\nThe names of each building to climb in the game are 'Nichibutsu', 'Nichibutsu Leisure', 'Nichibutsu U.K. Ltd.' and 'Nichibutsu U.S.A Corp.'.\r\n\r\nSome of the musical themes used in the game are 'Baby Elephant Walk', 'The Pink Panther Theme' and 'The Entertainer'.\r\n\r\nJim Wright holds the official record for this game with 487,150 points on July 5, 1982 with three starting lives.\r\nJason Cram holds the official record for this game with 301, 950 points on November 21, 2003 with four starting lives.\r\n\r\nA Crazy Climber unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III'.\r\n\r\nBandai released a board game based on this video game (same name): This game has you playing cards to move to the top of a building. Like in the arcade, there is the peril that people seem to drop just about anything out their windows at random times. Each card allows you to move to a particular position relative to where you currently are (for example, a choice of straight up two squares or up two squares and left or right one). However, there must be an open window that is not occupied by another player for it to be a legal move. Whenever a player passes certain checkpoints, the spinner is spun to see if anything falls from the windows. If you're hit on the head, you drop down to the next open window. There is also a gorilla that knocks you all the way down if you're unfortunate enough to be hit by him. First one to get to the top of the building and escape on the helicopter wins.\r\n\r\n- SCORING -\r\n\r\nEach building has a STEP POINT heading. This indicates how many points you get for each window you successfully climb to. You also start out with a certain amount of bonus points per building. On buildings one and two, they decrease by 100 about every 2 seconds while on buildings three and four they decrease by 200 points about every 2 seconds. Below are listed the STEP POINT and BONUS\r\nRATE points:\r\nBuilding 1 - Step Point: 100 - Bonus Rate: 10000\r\nBuilding 2 - Step Point: 150 - Bonus Rate: 20000\r\nBuilding 3 - Step Point: 200 - Bonus Rate: 30000\r\nBuilding 4 - Step Point: 250 - Bonus Rate: 40000\r\n\r\nNOTE: You will only collect the remaining BONUS RATE if you successfully grab the helicopter at the top of the building. If you fail to grab the helicopter after it has made two passes, you get a consolation bonus of 3000 points regardless of what the BONUS RATE remaining is.\r\n\r\nThe balloon shows up during buildings two and three. You don't get points, perse, for grabbing the balloon. Instead, your character will get lifted up approximately ten stories and avoiding any hazards they may contain. You will get STEP POINTS for these bypassed stories as if you had actually climbed them. In addition, it will give you a bigger bonus since it is quicker going up the building like this.\r\n\r\n- TIPS AND TRICKS -\r\n\r\n* When you start the game, your climber will climb a couple of steps. Then it will be up to you to guide him to the top of the building. The hardest aspect of this game is developing a rhythm with the controls to enable your climber to climb smoothly. This is something that takes practice. Fortunately, once you've developed this rhythm, the game is much easier to play. The basic rhythm is:\r\n1) From the bottom ledge, reach up to the next ledge (left or right joystick).\r\n2) Once you've got a hold on the next ledge, pull back on the joystick to bring your climber to the next ledge.\r\n3) Use the opposite joystick to reach for the next ledge. Then pull yourself up.\r\n4) Continue this rhythm for fast, straight climbs.\r\n5) This also works for climbing diagonally. Instead of reaching for the ledge above, reach for the upper right or left ledge diagonal from your climber.\r\n\r\n* You can move your climber from side to side just by pushing both joysticks to the right or left. As long as windows are open along your path, you can execute this move. Good for avoiding objects dropping on you such as signs and garbage.\r\n\r\n* All the buildings have the following hazards:\r\n1) Windows opening and closing: You cannot climb on a ledge if the window is closed. On building 1, they open and close slowly while on building 4, they open and close quickly.\r\n2) Bald people throwing flowerpots out the windows: You cannot climb on a ledge if a person is in the window. Also, if a flowerpot hits your climber, you will get one hand knocked off the ledge. If you were only holding on by one hand, your climber falls.\r\n3) A pesky bird flies over dropping nifty things on your climber (only building 3 doesn't have this bird): Again, not much trouble if you are holding onto a ledge with both hands.\r\n\r\n* If you are holding onto a ledge with both hands and the window closes, your climber will fall. This is why you need to either quickly move up the building or learn how to move diagonally to avoid the window hazards. In addition, you will have to move diagonally when the building configuration is 4-2.\r\n\r\n* BUILDING 1: Besides the above hazards, there is only one other hazard to deal with...\r\n1) The bird shows up when the building configuration goes from a 6-2-2 to a 6 for the second time.\r\n2) People will drop flowerpots on you when the building goes from 6-2-2 for the first time to 6-2-2 the second time.\r\n3) King Kong will be at the point where the building goes to 6-2 the second time. To get by Kong, just go up the windows on the opposite side Kong is on.\r\n\r\n* BUILDING 2: The usual hazards exist along with another new one.\r\n1) The bird shows up when the building configuration goes from 6-4 the second time to the middle of the 4 configuration.\r\n2) People drop flowerpots when the building goes to 2 until it goes to 2-4.\r\n3) When the building goes 6-2-2, there is a Nichibutsu sign with wires coming out of either side sparking away. The best path is the right one under the sign.\r\n4) Try to get the balloon which appears midway on the final 4 wide configuration.\r\n\r\n* BUILDING 3: There is yet another new hazard along with a couple of old ones.\r\n1) People drop flowerpots from the first 6-2-2 configuration to the second 6-2-2 configuration.\r\n2) Right after the 6-4 configuration, Crazy Climber signs will bounce toward your character. There are a couple of methods of dealing with them:\r\na) First, just slide left or right to avoid them.\r\nb) If they can't be avoided, get both hands on one ledge and pull the joysticks back. This will bring your climber for a hanging position to one where he is resting on his palms. This sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Also, right when the sign is about to hit him, pull back on the joysticks.\r\n3) Another King Kong awaits where the building goes from 4 to 2. Use the Building 1 method to scoot by him.\r\n4) Again, try to get the balloon which appears midway on the final 2 wide configuration.\r\n\r\n* BUILDING 4: There is another hazard in addition to the above. Plus, things happen quickly on this building.\r\n1) In the middle of the first 6-2-2 configuration, is another sign with electrical wires. Use the method from Building 2.\r\n2) The bird appears at the 6-2 configuration and leaves in the middle of the first 2 configuration.\r\n3) From the 2-6 configuration to the middle of the 6 configuration, people are dropping flowerpots on your head.\r\n4) When you come to the final 4-2 configuration, it is usually better to go to the left. This is because the Crazy Climber signs usually come down the right side. Of course, this isn't always true. Use the methods in Building 3 to deal with them.\r\n5) Throughout your climb up this building, various manners of barbells, trash. There is no real defense against these except hold on tightly.\r\n6) Once you complete this building, you are transported back to Building 1 to start again.\r\n\r\n* Secret Password: Enter the name 'jordan.ltd' in the high score table and you get two free credits.

The Print Club machines produce these small photo stickers (about 2.5 x 2 cm, slightly smaller than a postage stamp) which feature a large variety of superimposed frames which compliment the subject's faces. You just pay 300 yen, stand in front of a video monitor which shows your face, choose the desired frame, pose for the photo, then wait for a sheet of 16 photo stickers which the machine spits out in about a minute. The image quality is not so high (this is probably part of the charm), but the sticker is so small that it really doesn't matter. People affix the stickers on personal articles like notebooks, cell phones, etc. But mainly, school girls collect them to show friends.\r\n\r\n- TECHNICAL -\r\n\r\nRuns Sega \"System C-2\" hardware.\r\n\r\nPlayers: 1\r\nControl: 2-way joystick\r\nButtons: 2\r\n\r\n- TRIVIA -\r\n\r\n* Print Club History: The Print Club concept was invented in 1994-1995 by 30-year-old Sasaki Miho, a female employee of one of the two companies which developed the Print Club machine. Without a doubt, she has earned a place in Japan's pop culture history. She thought about how neat it would be to have a small photo sticker with your picture on it. And she thought about those cute stickers with cute characters on them which she stuck on her notebook, etc., during her college days. The first Print Club machine was introduced at a video arcade trade fair in Feb. 1995 before making its debut at video arcades later in June the same year. At first, nothing really happened. Then a popular teeny-bopper male singing group called SMAP started offering Print Club photo stickers of themselves to viewers of their TV program. Other TV stations started doing the same thing, offering viewers Print Club stickers by a drawing. This explains why Print Club first became popular among school girls. They were followers of their idol group, SMAP which includes heartthrob Kimura Takuya. Print Club consequently first caught on among Japanese female high schoolers who usually posed in pairs. The fad soon spread to younger school girls and by 1996, Print Club became widely popular among kids and adults alike. From the end of 1995, Print Club machine sales took off at 1.225 million yen per unit. By the end of 1996, 10,000 units were sold in Japan. By spring 1998, 25,000 Print Club machines (and many other imitation machines) were on the market. School girls may spend up to 2,000 yen per day for these stickers. There is even a store in Harajuku, Tokyo which sells old Print Club machines.\r\n\r\n* Why It's So Popular: Print Club is called a new communication tool. With so many frames having different messages such as 'Thank you', 'Happy New Year', and 'I love you', people are sticking them on letters, postcards, notebooks, business cards, etc. Even Ginza bar hostesses stick them on their cards so that customers remember them. It is also a social tool for these school girls since they are motivated to assemble these photo stickers with as many of their friends as they can. They want to show how many friends they have by posing with them on these stickers. And they show these stickers to their friends and share gossip. It's like getting your high school yearbook signed by as many people as possible (this custom, by the way, does not exist in Japan). They even use the stickers to set up introductions to the opposite sex. 'Print Club miai' occurs when a friend gives her photo stickers to another friend who shows them to a prospective boyfriend. They decide to meet or not by looking at their photo stickers. There was a time when girls stuck their Print Club stickers on a bulletin board next to the machine and wrote their beeper\/pager numbers as well, inviting calls from males for friendship or even 'financially-assisted relationships' (enjo kosai). These bulletin boards were later banned by the police. Print Club has since had a clean, positive image.\r\n\r\n* Spin-offs: With the huge success of Print Club, many other companies have gotten into the act. Print Club (a trademark) is no longer alone in the photo sticker market. You now have a wide choice of photo sticker machines from different manufacturers. The number of frames you can use is almost unlimited. But not only photo stickers, Print Club has inspired a slew of other imaginative machines for imaginative novelties. Some are fairly successful while others are not making much money. But none are as popular as photo sticker machines. For example, Sega Enterprises, one of the makers of the original Print Club machine, has introduced \"Stamp Club\" (a rubber stamp of your face in the frame of your choice), \"Name Club\" (for business cards [name and phone No. only] featuring a cartoon character), \"Movie Club\" (6 poses for an animated image), \"Calendar Club\" (1 sheet for a desktop calendar with your face), \"Aura Photo Club\" (captures the aura around your head and shoulders), and even \"Aroma Club\" which dispenses a vial of fragrance which the machine selects after the user answers a few health questions. The aroma is then supposed to help ease the user's health ailment. Then there is Voice de Holder (Voice Key Chain) which is a key chain with a voice message that you record in the booth. You can then give it to the person you want to give the message to. Although Sega Enterprises is leading the pack for these machines, rivals such as SNK, Konami, and Jaleco are also putting out new machines at a fast pace.\r\n\r\n- CONTRIBUTE -\r\n\r\nEdit this entry: https:\/\/www.arcade-history.com\/?&page=detail&id=2045&o=2","history_copyright_long":"Informations provided by\nArcade History\nhttp:\/\/www.arcade-history.com\n(C) Copyright Alexis Bousiges","history_copyright_short":"(C) arcade-history.com","youtube_video_id":"","url_video_shortplay":"","url_video_shortplay_hd":""}]}

The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus (originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return).\r\n\r\nShould any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Swee'Pea, the Sea Hag, and her vulture Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.\r\n\r\n- TECHNICAL -\r\n\r\nMost Popeye machines were upright cabinets, but cocktails were also available.

Almost all other Nintendo titles used alternate versions of this same cabinet. \"Mario Bros.\" was wider, \"Punch-Out!!\" was taller, etc., but they were still nearly identical. A dedicated Popeye machine will be blue, although you will sometimes see them in different colors (non-blue Popeyes are conversion cabinets).\r\n\r\nModel No. TPP2-UP\r\n\r\nMain CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)\r\nSound Chips: General Instrument AY8910 (@ 2 Mhz)\r\n\r\nPlayers: 2\r\nControl: 4-way joystick\r\nButtons: 1 (PUNCH)\r\n\r\n- TRIVIA -\r\n\r\nPopeye was released in December 1982 in Japan.\r\n\r\nLicensed to Atari for distribution in Ireland and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n* Popeye From Strip To Screen: Popeye the Sailor, one of the most enduring characters in animation history, began not in motion pictures but in E.C. 'Elzie' Segar's 'Thimble Theater' comic strip. Born in Illinois, Segar began cartooning in Chicago in 1914. Graduating to his own strip for the Chicago American, Segar was then hired in 1919 by Hearst's New York Evening Journal to create the syndicated 'Thimble Theater' strip. 'Thimble Theater' depicted the adventures of Ham Gravy, his girlfriend Olive Oyl and her brother Castor. The venture was a success, expanding to an additional Sunday color page in 1924. Segar's comic strip used complex, rambling and frequently eerie narratives that attracted a devoted following, but it lacked strong central characters. In the 'Thimble Theater' of January 17, 1929, Ham and Castor decided to hire a crew to sail in search of the legendary Whiffle Hen. Walking up to a grizzled one-eyed mariner on a dock, Castor asked him, \"Are you a sailor?\" \"`Ja think I'm a cowboy?\" came the reply, introducing Popeye to readers.\r\n\r\n* Move Over, Ham Gravy: Over a period of months, Popeye developed from a supporting character to the central figure in the hunt for the Whiffle Hen. When Segar finally brought the narrative to a close and tried to retire the sailor, outraged fans contacted the Hearst syndicate demanding more adventures with Popeye. Segar obliged them: the sailor replaced Ham as Olive's love interest, Castor Oyl was reduced to infrequent appearances, and the strip was renamed 'Thimble Theater, Starring Popeye'.\r\n\r\nThe early 1930s was a period of keen competition among American animation studios for market share. Central to the business strategy of most studios was the development of cartoon 'stars' whose popularity would ensure bookings by major theater chains. Disney followed the success of Mickey Mouse by developing new characters like Donald Duck and Goofy up from supporting roles in Mickey Mouse cartoons. Similar strategies were tried at Warner Bros., where Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck evolved from secondary roles in films starring other animated characters. One of the earliest examples of this took place at the Fleischer Studios, Inc. in New York, where the unpopular starring canine character Bimbo was matched up with a girlfriend in Dizzy Dishes (1930). The girlfriend eventually developed into Betty Boop, the studio's major character. With the popularity of Betty Boop at a peak in 1932, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer decided to introduce a new film series which would include another character to grow into a star. Fleischer rival Van Beuren Corporation had already signed an agreement to bring Otto Soglow's strip 'The Little King' to the screen. Max Fleischer, who was a great fan of Segar's strip, approached Hearst's King Features Syndicate for the right to use Popeye. The two companies signed an agreement on November 17, 1932.\r\n\r\n* Betty introduces Popeye to the Big Screen: The production of the first Popeye film took place in secrecy. Veteran animator Roland Crandall was given space apart from the rest of the studio. There, he single-handedly animated the entire cartoon, aided only by the inclusion of some Shamus Culhane animation recycled from the earlier Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle (1932). The results were so satisfying that even before the film was released, the Fleischers and King Features amended the agreement granting the studio the right to produce and release animated cartoons featuring Popeye for a five year period.\r\n\r\nCrandall's film 'Betty Boop Presents Popeye The Sailor' opened in the summer of 1933 as part of the 'Betty Boop' series. After a prologue in which newspapers herald the sailor's film debut, and Popeye sings 'I'm Popeye the Sailor Man', the film featured what was to be the standard 'Popeye' series plot, re-enacted with variations by the Fleischers for the next decade. Olive waits for Popeye to disembark from his ship at the dock. Bluto follows the couple to a fairground, where the two sailors compete for Olive's attentions through feats of strength. Bluto abducts Olive and ties her to a train track. As the locomotive approaches, Popeye and Bluto fight. Popeye defeats Bluto, and, through the magical powers of spinach, is able to stop the train and save Olive Oyl. Here, we see the essential difference between the Segar and Fleischer sense of narrative. Segar reveled in picaresque plots that coursed in unexpected directions for up to two years, exploring every novel twist and nuance of narrative. In anticipation of post-modernism, the very concept of plot was old-fashioned to the Fleischers. Hackneyed and ritualized story conventions were torn apart, recombined in odd juxtapositions, and satirized in endless variations.\r\n\r\nThe Fleischer Popeye cartoons were an instant success. \"It might have been just a fluke, a lucky break, that the Segar characters fit the Fleischer style so well\", recalls former Popeye animator Myron Waldman. \"The animation of Olive Oyl in the mid-1930s was perfect. It fit her. The character had no elbows and the most prominent knees. When she spoke, the voice fit too. This was character. That's what made her so good\".\r\n\r\n* Step Aside, Mickey: Segar's characters were not the only things consistent with the Fleischer style. Both Segar and the Fleischer staff shared a fondness for a poetically improvisational language. When Popeye's original voice artist, William 'Red Pepper Sam' Costello, left after the first few pictures, he was replaced by a studio in-betweener named Jack Mercer. Much of the dialogs of the Popeye cartoons was post-synched with little attention to synchronized mouth action. Mercer, Mae Questel (Olive's voice, except for the 1938-41 period, when Margie Hines was the voice artist) and William Penell or Gus Wickie, who voiced Bluto, often ad-libbed dialogs during recording sessions, particularly Popeye's 'asides' and pun-filled conversations. Added to this was a progressive softening and increased complexity of Popeye's character, paralleling changes in the strip. Popeye cartoons became the Fleischers' leading attraction. By 1938, Popeye replaced Mickey Mouse as the most popular cartoon character in America.\r\n\r\nThe Fleischers rummaged through the Segar strip for supporting characters. Bluto, the animated series' antagonist, was a minor character in the Segar strip, appearing only in 1933's 'The Eighth Sea'. Longer-lived strip characters that joined Popeye on the screen included hamburger maven J. Wellington Wimpy, Swee'Pea, Eugene the Jeep and Poopdeck Pappy. While in the comic strip, Popeye gained his great strength from rubbing the Whiffle Hen, the Fleischers added the gimmick of Popeye's power being largely dependent on the ingestion of spinach. Farmers in America's self-styled 'spinach capital' of Crystal City, Texas set up a statue of Popeye in gratitude for the publicity.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1935, the Fleischers sought backing for a feature-length animated film from their distributor Paramount. Paramount refused to risk money on a feature. In an attempt to persuade the company that longer animated films could be profitable, Max Fleischer initiated the production of three two-reel color 'specials' starring Popeye, beginning with 'Popeye The Sailor Meets Sinbad The Sailor' (1936). Although these 'specials' were often billed over their accompanying feature, Paramount still refused to back the animated feature.\r\n\r\nConditions changed after the success of Disney's 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs' (1937) and the Fleischers received money for the eighty minute Gulliver's Travels. According to some sources, the film was originally to have Popeye in the role of Gulliver, but the idea was scrapped early in the planning stages. Perhaps this was unwise. According to internal Paramount correspondence, the Popeye shorts were far more profitable to Paramount than Disney's films were to his distributor, RKO. The sailor's box-office appeal might have helped the Fleischer features. Gulliver's Travels (1938) and the company's next feature, Mr. Bug Goes To Town (1941), bombed, leading to the failure of Fleischer Studios, Inc.\r\n\r\n* Post-Fleischer Popeye: The successor company, Famous Studios, continued with the production of Popeye cartoons. Many of these were remakes of earlier Fleischer films. Much of the supporting cast of the Fleischer versions were replaced by new characters, such as identical nephews Pip-Eye, Peep-Eye, Poop-Eye and Pup-Eye. A redesign of the major characters included white U.S. Navy uniforms for Bluto and Popeye (in keeping with their war-time service in the armed forces), and more comely fashions for Olive. Upgraded technology, including the introduction of color to the series in 1943 with Her Honor The Mare and 3-D in Popeye The Ace Of Space (1953), tried to rejuvenate the series. None of these strategies were able to breathe much life into the films. Spooky Swabs (1957) brought theatrical release of Popeye films to a close.\r\n\r\nThe success of the black and white Popeye cartoons on television in the 1950s inspired several revivals of the series by such talents as Gene Deitch, John Halas and Joy Batchelor, Jack Kinney, and Hanna-Barbera. Hampered by limited budgets and rushed production schedules, none of these came close to the Fleischer or Famous theatrical versions. The less said about Robert Altman's live-action feature with Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall as Popeye and Olive Oyl, the better. What has endured are the original qualities of the Segar and Fleischer works. In fact, Segar's strips have been reissued by Nostalgia Press and the Smithsonian Press. The earlier Fleischer films, which shared the shabby urban or surreal exotic locations and working-class orientation of the Segar originals, retain a vitality and charm that still appeal to a large group of devoted fans today. \r\n\r\n* Bluto\/Brutus issue: Bluto's name was changed to Brutus after the theatrical Popeye cartoon series went out of production in 1957. It was wrongly believed that Paramount Pictures, distributors of the Fleisher Studios cartoon, owned the rights to the name Bluto. (King Features owned the name all along as Bluto had been originally created for the comic strip.) However, with poor research, they couldn't realize this, and renamed him Brutus to avoid copyright problems. \"Brutus\" appeared in the 1960-1962 Popeye television cartoons (with his physical appearance changed, making him obese rather than muscular), but he is again \"Bluto\" (and back to his original muscular physique) in the 1978 Hanna-Barbera Popeye series and the 1980 live-action Popeye movie, as well as the 1987 Popeye and Son series also by Hanna-Barbera. The character was named Bluto in the 2004 movie \"Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy\". Nintendo used the name \"Brutus\" for the character in this arcade game.\r\n\r\n- UPDATES -\r\n\r\nREVISION D (used on most Popeye machines): \r\n* First level has a black background.\r\n* Default high score is 32,600.\r\n* First nickname on the default high-score table is GET.\r\n* Spinach can only be used once per level, and it is not restored after you lose a life.\r\n* The ladder at the center of the first level can only be used to go down.\r\n* Extra Life dip-switch can be set at 40,000, 60,000, 80,000, or None. The default is 40,000, meaning you get an extra life at 40,000 points.\r\n\r\nREVISION F (designed especially for novice players):\r\n* First level has a colored background.\r\n* Default high-score is smaller than on Revision D: 25,600.\r\n* First nickname on the default high-score table is KAC.\r\n* Spinach is restored after you lose a life.\r\n* The ladder at the center of the first level can be used to go up or down.\r\n* Extra Life dip-switch can be set at 20,000, 30,000, 50,000, or None, with 20,000 as the default.\r\n\r\nBOOTLEG:\r\n* No copyright\r\n\r\n- SCORING -\r\n\r\nCollecting a heart, note, or letter on the...\r\n1st floor: 50 points(1)\r\n2nd floor: 100 points(1)\r\n3rd floor: 300 points(1)\r\n4th floor: 500 points(1)\r\nPunching the punch-bag: 30 points\r\nPunching a bottle: 100 points\r\nPunching a skull: 100 points\r\nPunching Bernard: 1,000 points\r\nUsing Spinach power to knock Brutus into the water: 3,000 points\r\nDropping the bucket on Brutus' head when he's on the...\r\n1st floor: 4,000 points\r\n2nd floor: 2,000 points\r\n3rd floor: 1,000 points\r\nHitting Swee'Pea's platform from below: 500 points(1)\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Punch button is not required to punch Brutus or Bernard when Popeye has Spinach power.\r\n\r\n(1) denotes values that are doubled if Popeye has Spinach power.\r\n\r\n- TIPS AND TRICKS -\r\n\r\n* A Display Glitch: On the musical note level, you can stand at the point on the edge where you 'wraparound' and if you punch a bottle in the right spot, it'll erase part of the 'THRU' sign. This can be done on both sides.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL ONE:\r\n\r\n1) On the first level, Olive Oyl stands at the top of the screen and throws 24 hearts (one at a time) down to the bottom, hoping that Popeye will catch them all. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, you will have about 10 seconds to pick it up before it breaks, costing you one life. Try to catch the hearts as high as possible, since they decrease in value as they get closer to the bottom.\r\n\r\n2) When Brutus harasses you, cross the edge of the screen from left to right and wait for him to stop directly underneath the bucket. Hit the punching bag at this point and the bucket will fall onto his head, rendering him helpless for a while. This will score you points based on which floor Brutus is on when you hit him (see Scoring above) and give you some time to catch a few more hearts.\r\n\r\n3) Like in the cartoons, Popeye becomes stronger after eating Spinach. A can of Spinach moves between the second and third floors of the screen and you can have Popeye eat it by punching the can. Afterwards, Popeye will turn red and become stronger than Brutus for about 10 seconds (shorter in later levels). If you can punch Brutus at this time, he falls into the sea, temporarily knocking him out, and you will be awarded 3,000 points.\r\n\r\n4) Brutus will eventually recover so make good use of this time by catching as many falling hearts as possible. They don't move, and they are worth twice as much when Popeye is under the influence of Spinach, so catching some of the higher hearts can really help your score. And since extra lives are only awarded at a very high score (40,000 points on most machines; 20,000 points by default on Revision F machines), you should be as greedy as possible.\r\n\r\n5) Spinach can only be used once per level, and it is never restored after you lose a life (except in Revision F, see Updates above). Do not use it too soon. Collect about two thirds of the total number of hearts, and have as many hearts fill the air as possible before getting the Spinach.\r\n\r\n6) If you want to risk getting 4000 points instead of 2,000, do not use the punching bag immediately. Wait until you have punched Brutus (best done after eating Spinach) and position Popeye to the punching bag. After Brutus comes out of the sea, he will move underneath the bucket on the bottom floor. With some practice and timing you should be able to drop the bucket onto his head for 4,000 points. NOTE: Touching Brutus while the bucket is on his head is not fatal. But be careful, because after the bucket comes off he can easily knock out Popeye.\r\n\r\n7) To make up for his lumbering slowness, Brutus is capable of throwing beer bottles at Popeye. You should try to force him to throw bottles as often as possible (four at a time) instead of avoiding them, so you can score extra points.\r\n\r\n8) The Sea Hag also throws bottles, except she only throws one at a time. The Sea Hag materializes on the edge of the screen for a moment, chucks a bottle, and disappears. She can also be on both sides of the screen at once. So if you are caught between two Sea Hags or between Brutus and the Sea Hag, you will have to be quick on the joystick and Punch button to survive. \r\n\r\n* LEVEL TWO: The second level is much like the first, except Olive Oyl is dropping musical notes now (16 of them, one at a time). The major difference is the layout, with Wimpy on the plank in the lower left corner. If Popeye jumps off the second floor, he will be catapulted up to the third floor. With some careful timing, you can even make Popeye leap all the way up to the fourth floor, where Swee'Pea is waiting on a balloon platform. Touching the bottom of Swee'Pea's platform will score 500 points (1000 points while under the influence of Spinach).\r\n\r\n* LEVEL THREE:\r\n\r\n1) The setting for the third level is a ship, with a sliding platform on the top floor. At the beginning of the board you should be able to slide Popeye across the platform several times, catching the letters H-E-L-P that Olive Oyl is dropping directly above.\r\n\r\n2) Every time Popeye catches a letter, one step is added to a ladder which goes up to Olive Oyl. When the ladder is finished, Olive Oyl is rescued. This is the most difficult level because a total of 24 letters are needed to complete the ladder and save Olive Oyl. Bernard, the vulture, will constantly appear from the left side of the screen. While sliding back and forth across the platform, you should try to punch Bernard as many times as possible, to score 1,000 points per punch.\r\n\r\n3) After Popeye has rescued Olive Oyl on the third level, there will be an intermission that will have Popeye's face while \"I'm Popeye The Sailor Man\" plays followed by Popeye blowing his pipe and going \"Toot! Toot!\". Afterwards, the game begins again with increased difficulty.\r\n\r\nOn ALL levels, Brutus can reach from underneath or bend down from higher floors to lower ones. Be careful that you are not underneath him. \r\n\r\nWhen the game restarts from the first level with increased difficulty, the Sea Hag will start throwing down deadly bouncing skulls from the edges of the screen that must be punched when they are bouncing upward. You must also make sure that there are no skulls directly above Popeye, since they drop down a floor or two and hit him on the head. \r\n\r\nContinue to avoid Brutus, Bernard, the beer bottles, and the skulls, and keep catching whatever Olive Oyl throws down.\r\n\r\n- PORTS -\r\n\r\n* CONSOLES:\r\n[FR] Philips G7000 Videopac (1982) \r\n[BR] Philips Odyssey (1983) \r\n[JP] Nintendo Famicom (jul.15, 1983) \"Popeye [Model HVC-PP]\"\r\n[EU] Nintendo NES (sept.1, 1986) \"Popeye [Model NES-PP]\"\r\n\r\n* COMPUTERS:\r\n[EU] Commodore C64 (1984)\r\n\r\n- CONTRIBUTE -\r\n\r\nEdit this entry: https:\/\/www.arcade-history.com\/?&page=detail&id=2015&o=2","history_copyright_long":"Informations provided by\nArcade History\nhttp:\/\/www.arcade-history.com\n(C) Copyright Alexis Bousiges","history_copyright_short":"(C) arcade-history.com","youtube_video_id":"","url_video_shortplay":"","url_video_shortplay_hd":""}]}

A third poster advertises 'Ristorante Donnaloia' an expensive Italian restaurant in Kobe, which still exists to this day. Also on this stage the name and likeness of at that time Capcom USA Vice President of Sales and Marketing 'Bill Cravens' is grafittied on the shutter in front of the 'Block Heads' pub.\r\n\r\nThe title screen has several Capcom games listed on the brick wall: \"Avengers\", \"Commando\", Wings (\"Legendary Wings\"), and \"Trojan\".\r\n\r\nIn May 1988, Pony Canyon released a Game Simulation Video VHS tape featuring approx. 20 minutes of gameplay footage from this game.\r\n\r\nAlfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music Vol.2 - 28XA-203) on March 25, 1988.\r\n\r\nA Street Fighter unit can be seen in the 1992 film 'Juice' starring Omar Epps and the late Tupac Shakur.\r\n\r\n- UPDATES -\r\n\r\nThe Japanese version:\r\n* Has different words spoken for Ryu and Ken during their special moves than the other versions. Ryu and Ken shout 'hadoken!', 'shoryuken!' and 'tatsu-maki-senpuu-kyaku!' during respective special moves in the Japanese version, while they shout 'hellfire!', 'dragon punch!' and 'hurricane!' on all other versions.\r\n\r\nThe prototype version:\r\n* Has no demo mode.\r\n* Different colors on highscore table.\r\n* Different hole on in the wall during the title screen.\r\n* Is highly bugged.\r\n* No digitized voice samples.\r\n* Characters share stage music.\r\n* Ryu's victory pose is visually different.\r\n* Different sound effects for everything.\r\n* Different intro\/outro music.\r\n* Must win three rounds to win the match.\r\n* Typo in victory quote screen, 'Rut Don't Forget...' instead of 'But Don't Forget...'.\r\n* No stage select when you start the game.\r\n* The Hurricane Kick does not seem to be in the game.\r\n\r\n- TIPS AND TRICKS -\r\n\r\nPerforming special moves: Unlike pretty much every other fighting game, this game requires the player to \"release\" the buttons instead of pressing them to attack. This applies to special moves as well. A tip to do them easily is to hold the attack button as soon as you start the motion and release it as soon as you finish it. \r\n\r\nTurtling with Mike: When fighting Mike, you can turtle-up in the corner and he will just repeatedly throw low punches at you (which you can block). You can use this to your advantage by letting time run out if you have more energy than he does.\r\n\r\nSingle-Move Victory with Birdie: When fighting Birdie, if you do a hurricane kick right at the start of the round, you can 'sometimes' get him will all of the kicks (he will not be knocked back) and defeat him with that one move alone.\r\n\r\n- SERIES -\r\n\r\n1.

In a turf war, the Dead End Gang has kidnapped Kute Kate from the rivals, the Cobras. The Cobras set out to save her and stop the expansion of the Dead End Gang in Vendetta.\r\n\r\nThe Dead End Gang is looking to expand their territory, so the Cobras must infiltrate every area around the city. First, they must gain entrance to Dead End City. Relying on their fighting skills, the Cobras face a multitude of enemies. However, each member is up for any challenge from the Dead End Gang. The Cobras are a powerful team consisting of: Blood, an ex-prize fighter; Hawk, a former professional wrestler; Boomer, trained in the martial arts; and Sledge, an ex-military convict. Together they must destroy members of the Dead End Gang to get to the leader, Faust, who knows where Kute Kate is being held.\r\n\r\nWith fists of fury, the Cobras make their way through various areas of Dead End City. They search the construction site for Kate, battling the humanoid weapon The Missing Link to gain information. From there, they are sent on futile chases through other sections of the city, including downtown, the waterfront, and the slums, where the final confrontation with Faust takes place. Throughout the game, the Cobras can pick up special weapons and food for more energy. Each player also has his own 'special attack' method to help defeat the toughest enemies.\r\n\r\nOnce Kute Kate is rescued and Dead End City is liberated, the Cobras victoriously start back to their home turf. However, much to their surprise, the entrance to their town is blocked by Dead End Gang bosses. The Cobras must gear up once more for the ultimate showdown to restore peace to Dead End City.\r\n\r\n- TECHNICAL -\r\n\r\nGame ID: GX081\r\n\r\nMain CPU: Konami (@ 6 Mhz)\r\nSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)\r\nSound Chips: Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), K053260 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)\r\n\r\nPlayers: 2\r\nControl: 8-way joystick\r\nButtons: 2\r\n=> Attack, Jump\r\n\r\n- TRIVIA -\r\n\r\nCrime Fighters 2 was released in July 1991 in Japan.

Both moves do a lot of damage, taking up 5 life squares unless your partner can rescue you from the hold.\r\n\r\nBilly Lee, the main character of the \"Double Dragon\" series, is visible among the first row of the cheering crowd.\r\n\r\nThe game also features appearances from Virgil (the manager of Andre and DiBiase), 'Mean' Gene Okerlund (the announcer) and Miss Elizabeth (1960-2003) who appears in a cut-scene when you win the tag team titles.\r\n\r\nWrestler's real names:\r\nHulk Hogan - Terry Gene Bollea\r\nRandy Savage - Randall Mario \"Randy\" Poffo (1952-2011)\r\nThe Ultimate Warrior - Warrior (born James Brian \"Jim\" Hellwig but legally changed his name to Warrior in 1993) (1959-2014)\r\n'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan - James Edward \"Jim\" Duggan, Jr.\r\nThe Big Boss Man - Raymond W. \"Ray\" Traylor, Jr. (1962-2004)\r\nHonky Tonk Man - Roy Wayne Farris\r\nAndre The Giant - Andr\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 Roussimoff (1946-1993)\r\nTed DiBiase - Theodore Marvin \"Ted\" DiBiase, Sr.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the game's release, the actual WWF Tag Team Champions were The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard) who are absent from the game.  DiBiase and Andre (known as The Mega Bucks), never won the tag teams titles.\r\n\r\nAlso at the time of release, 'Ravishing' Rick Rude (1958-1999) was the WWF Intercontinental Champion but he too is absent from the game.\r\n\r\n- UPDATES -\r\n\r\nThe US version is slightly different, it has the \"Winners Don't Use Drugs\" screen.\r\n\r\n- TIPS AND TRICKS -\r\n\r\n* There's a mildly amusing glitch in WWF Superstars involving Randy Savage. Use him & then pick anyone else and play until you face Andre and DiBiase.\r\n1) With Savage as your active wrestler and Andre as the legal man, climb in and out of the bottom of the ring until Andre decides to climb out after you. When you begin to see those first few animation frames of his lumbering descent, quickly walk backwards to the left side of the screen.\r\n2) Dash at Andre so that the instant his final animation frame has him standing on the ring floor you'll have connected with a flying clothesline. For a second, you will have 'pulled' an additional Andre out of the standing Andre's body with that flying clothesline! The standing Andre vanishes once the clothesline has taken its course and the prostrate Andre then becomes the active sprite.\r\n\r\n- SERIES -\r\n\r\n1. WWF Superstars [Model TA-0024] (1989)\r\n2.
